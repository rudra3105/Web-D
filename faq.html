<!-- use div OR p tag so the text will wrap with mobile/responsiveness. Don't use button tag. -->
<div class="accordion"><b>Do I share your information? </b>
</div>
<div class="panel">
	<p><i>Under no circumstances</i>  do I share any Information with anyone. All contracted work is 100% confidential and privileged between myself and you the client. You may also request that I destroy or permantly delete this Information once its no longer applicable to us or our contract.</p>
</div>
		<div class="accordion"><b> Do you have to use the contact me page for simple changes?</b>
		</div>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>No, you do not have to use the contact-me submission form if you are an exisisting client. You can simply  <a href="mailto:rudrabhatt570@gmail.com?subject=RE%3A%20Update%20web%20content&amp;body=Please%20include%20your%20full%20name%2C%20business%20name%20and%20website%20name.%20%0AThanks%20again!%20 " target="_blank">send us an email</a>  to make a change. The contact-me submission form is for new clients who want to know how we manage thier content i.e., wordpress management, build thier website from scratch, contracts ect...</p>
		</div>
		<div class="accordion"><b> How do I manage your website(s)?</b>
		</div>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>All websites are managed with with the wordpress content management system. It is very rare that we will manage a website with cPanel. Anything that involves cPanel management will most likley be a website that is made entirely from scratch. 
		 </p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="accordion"><b>Is a contract required for monthly services?</b> </div>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Contracts are only nessessary when we start business with a client <i>initially</i>. There has to be a transaction involoving money for services. We will chat and find out what exactly is needed for a project. <i>Reccuring monthly payments will be defined in the contract</i> .</p>
		</div>

		<div class="accordion"><b>Types of contracts with us and your business?</b></div>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>The types of contracts we use are typically pay per services. We like to make doing business as simple as possible. We don't use hourly tracking software because it is challenging for both me and a client to keep track and bill. Pay per project is more transparent for us. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="accordion"><b> What are some <i>FREE</i> services you offer?</b></div>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Some <i>free</i> services we offer are advice regarding the IT and web development industry. Maybe you don't know where <i>or</i> how to start.
